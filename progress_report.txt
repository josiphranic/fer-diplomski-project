22.4. 	Trained separate unet models on sfu and kbc datasets.

	Tried to make better results with transfer learning by using model pretrained on sfu dataset.
	Pretrained model encoder was frozen for training and last layer of model was changed to give
	desired output number of classes(Conv2D filter number was updated, kernel size remains (1, 1)).
	Results was worse then model trained only on sfu dataset.
	
	Data saved: only kbc dataset: 'models/kbc_sm/results/2020-04-21_18:04:57.706024'
		    only sfu dataset: 'models/sfu/results/2020-04-21_02:34:32.802993'
		    pretrained on sfu dataset and fine tuned on kbc: 'models/kbc_sm_pretrained_encoder_sfu/results/2020-04-21_23:12:10.733253'
